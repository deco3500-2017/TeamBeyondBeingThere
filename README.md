## Introduction - needs improvement

There are a lot of clubs on UQ campus, but some UQ students who have joined club find it is hard to keep connected to the latest news and make friends with other members.In addition, it requires great efforts and much time for UQ club and society committee members to recruit new members and promote an event. So, we want to create  an application that strengthen the connection between members and club organizers and Organizational work efficiency.

----------


### Preliminary research
#### <i class="icon-file"></i> Interviews
We first conducted interviews within our team to get a better understanding of students’ pain points in their social lives at UQ. Nan, Peter and Alvin were the interviewers and Tony and Danson were the interviewees. (Note: When we were conducting the interviews, we just chose the “active community” as our topic, but had no idea about what to design or build.)

>Tony is currently a member of UQ Boxing Club. Based on the interview, we found:
>
 1. Even though Tony joined the club and attended regular boxing classes, he felt lacking communication with other participants, most of whom were UQ students.
 2. Tony knew the Boxing club regularly held other events, such as welcome BBQ, but he did not attend it. Because he had no idea about whether it was past or when it would be held.
 3. The main approaches that Tony got news from the club were Facebook and regular classes.
 4. Tony would continue to be a member of Boxing Club, because he thought he could build his body and learn boxing skills.
 5. In a boxing class, members were paired. But Tony did not make friends with his partners, potentially because he could not exchange contact details in the class.
 6. He made friends with other members (not his partners) and maintained relationships in WeChat (a popular instant messaging app in China).


----------


>Danson has two roles. First we interviewed Danson as a potential member of UQ Beer Club. He was interested in the activities (we call them events in the rest of the proposal) that the club held, but he did not join it. We found:
>
 1. He was interested in the events because he loved beer. He knew there was a Beer Club at UQ, but did not participate in any of the events it held.
 2. He had no friends to go together with him.
 3. Most of the club members were local students, as he observed. So he was afraid of language barriers and cultural differences.


----------

>And then, we continued to interview Danson as a committee member (we call him an organiser in the rest of the proposal) of UQ Chinese Student and Scholar Association. He worked for the society as an HR, and based on his experience, we found:
>
 1. His main job was to recruit new committee members for the society.
 2. He found it hard to keep a balance between study and society jobs.
 3. He needed some motivation because he repeated to do similar tasks.
 4. One of his task was to inform candidates of the time and place to be interviewed. A typical process how a candidate was informed is illustrated below:

#### <i class="icon-file"></i> Questionnaire
Later on, we designed and distributed an online questionnaire and collected 64 responses in two days. The main findings from the questionnaire are listed below and sorted by the role of participants:

>For potential members:
>
 1. 42% respondents have never joined a club.
 2. 18% of the potential members are not interested in clubs.
 3. They expect an active social club that matches their interests and have some free events.
 4. Activities they like at UQ are: (1) freebies (2) Market Day (3) study (4) sports.


----------
>For existing members:
>
 1. 93.5% of them get information about clubs on the Market Day.
 2. They rate the activeness of the club they join as average.
 3. 25% of existing members have never participated in any event.
 4. Main motivations of joining a club are making friends and personal interests.
 5. 61% of them get latest news from clubs via social media, such as Facebook.
 6. They care about the time, place of the event, whether it is free, whether it is interesting, whether their friends attend, the outcomes, and communication.
 7. It is hard for them to make decisions to participate.
 8. Some of them find disconnected from the club.


----------
>For organisers (who are also existing members):
>
 1. They rate the activeness of the club as high.
 2. All of them use Facebook to inform members of news.
 3. They hold events at least once per month.
 4. They have trouble in organising information, promoting events, collaboration, being motivated and supported.
 5. Their attitudes towards a new mobile social app vary.


----------


### Literature review - needs improvement
According to the research about the relation between the members and organizations, we found out that members would treasure the connection between the organization and themselves which commitments and rewards are traded at the same level.(Ren-Tao, 2011). To adapt this theory, in this concept, we decided to made a novel system which allows the system or organizations themselves to reward members according to the attributes they conducted.  In this way, users’ motivation can be stimulated significantly which can reduce the current situation that organizations lack of active members to participate events and perform certain tasks. 

With the rise of social media, it is much convenient for individual or organization to publicise and advertise their certain purpose. They will no longer only rely on traditional marketing and public relations. Kietzmann etc. had claimed a framework of seven functional blocks to introduce each important part of social media, which includes identity, conversations, sharing, presence, relationships, reputation, and groups (Kietzmann, Hermkens, McCarthy, & Silvestre, 2011).
![The honeycomb of social media](https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/nanzheng.design/sociaomobilecomputing/honeycomb.jpg "The honeycomb of social media")
It is useful for us to explore our own application by following these principles. As the features of our application is particular, which provoke us focusing on the Groups, Reputation, and conversation.

### idea - needs clarification

## Concept

The goal of our project is to improve the social connections between members and clubs. It allows members to know more about various clubs and societies and the events they hold. It helps members make decisions when choosing clubs to join and events to attend. For organisers, the app is designed to facilitate club management and event operation. To achieve these goals, our team have decided to design a mobile app as the final form of our product. Due to the fact that users would like to be informed about adjacent events and access all the information anywhere, anytime, mobile phones would be the best platform for our product. Within a mobile app, all the utility and functionalities can be integrated effectively.

#### <i class="icon-file"></i> Offer users an information publishment and sharing system by providing an integrated platform to help users to expand the way of knowing clubs events and increase the effectiveness of holding various events.
: The the core functionality will be novel integrated event information systems for both organizers and other students. For organizers, at the stage of planning of a future event, the platform will publish the general basic detail of it and collect feedbacks from other users for opinions. Then the organizers are able to use the data to change and adapt the event and activity. This can significantly prevent or solve the potential situations of holding an activity that no one interested to come or the event which can be a time and financial waste for the organization. As for students who are interested joining a club or event, this platform will exist as the official means of publishing related events information which provides related detailed information of related events according to the users preferences. Thus, the former situation that members can’t receive events’ notifications or receiving duplicate information from various media approaches will be solved. 
#### <i class="icon-file"></i> Providing an activeness evaluation system and corresponding  rewarding system for all participants to stimulate members’ motivation.
: Additionally, the product provides a new activeness evaluation system that will give different valuation on members in different clubs based on their contribution to the clubs such as attending an event and clubs activities arrangements etc… The valuation of activeness will be showed in form of levels. According to the “level” in certain club and student society, different image frame and unique badge will be given as system special identity rewards and  the organizers can personalize their own rewards based on that as well. This will positively encourage all members in the clubs to participant and support related events and provide organizers a general view of member activities. 
#### <i class="icon-file"></i> Changing the traditional mode for studenting joining students’ clubs and organizations. 
: At last, after analysis of the data received from questionnaires, over ninety percent of the students receive clubs information from market day which leads to that fact that they will need to decide whether to join the club or not without attending any related events and activities. To change this traditional means of joining clubs. The system provides a unique way for users by simply choosing a preferred relation to the certain club. Currently, the user are allowed to choose relations as “Following” which will be marked as potential member, “Participating” as the causal member, “Joined” as the loyalty member of the club. Through this system, all users can join multiple clubs according to personal interests easily. At meantime the scale of each organization can be enlarged significantly.


----------


### Target audience
General speaking, the audience of The UQ Club Hub is the current students of UQ in St Lucia campus. Since almost all the events and activities are held in campus, it is convenient for students to use the app to check the events agenda and participate immediately. Every students who is interested in any events or clubs held in campus is the audience of this application.

### Expected outcomes
If our product were fully developed and being widely used by UQ students, the formal organization operating mode would be changed. Firstly, all users will be using our app as the priority approach receiving events information according to their customised interests filter. Also, UQ students are able to find out all the basic information about all the student clubs and societies including name, previous events, leadership, regulation and description of the organization etc... Users now have a simple way find out which clubs to join in by their preference without the limitation of time and location, and don’t have to worry missing the Market Day which is the major time for participating organizations. 

Additionally, the system are able to import the data of your friend list in the facebook, then users can see their friends name under certain event section. What’s more, users can make new friends that sharing the same interests and had participated same events by watching their personal profile and linking back to their facebook. The system itself provides a reward system to all users by giving special badges and levels according to the contributions they made to the club. Thus, the motivation of participating the club activities can be increased. As for organizers, by using this app, they are now able to publish a future event or activity and receive feedbacks from users. So they can make adjustment to the event which prevents potential commercial cost and increase the quality of the event itself. Also, they are able to present their organizations to the potential members by fulfilling the description and other essential information about the organization itself which save the time constructing redundant club website or booking places especially for propagating the club.

All in all, the application can not only simplify the process of participating clubs and arranging club events for all users but also enhance the connection between the organizations and club members which can significantly stimulate the overall UQ students organization development.

### Decision-making
Everyone has the right to make a decision. Generally, we use a fair method-vote to make a decision after several discussions. We have a regular meeting every week. Each member participants the meeting, discussion, data collection and analysis. During the meeting, we review the previous work and discuss new task. Everyone talk their idea and list it on the whiteboard. Then we choose the suitable one according to the project requirements. If there are two ideas meet the requirements at the same time, we will make a concept map to analyze them. Plus, we could ask the tutor or teacher to give us some suggestions. 


----------


### Conflict-solving
We cannot ensure that everyone has equivalent workload. However, we will allocate task to each member fairly according to the responsibility table and project plan. If someone performing poorly or cannot finish the personal task on time, our group will talk with this member. If there is necessary, a warning will be given. If this situation happens more than three times, we will talk to the tutor or teacher. In case we cannot finish the project on time. During the meeting, each member needs to report the current work and the future plan. This is a kind of way to supervise group members with a positive attitude in the project progress.  
 
We will try our best to avoid the conflicts. The regular meeting and decision making method provides a good way to express personal idea. If a conflict happens, we will give members enough time to clarify their thought. Group member will together analyze the reason and problem of the conflict. If a big conflict happens in our group, we will ask other groups to involve to coordinate. Otherwise, we will look for a help from the teacher and tutor. However, we will as far as possible avoid the conflict.

## Communication

### Regular meeting sessions
The team has a regular 2-hour meeting at the workshop on Tuesday afternoon. Since team members have signed onto different practical sessions, we plan to attend the second half of P01 and the first half of P02 on Wednesdays, which is another two hour. If needed, extra meeting or working time will be discussed according to the team members’ available time.


----------


### Platforms for communication
The team has set up a Github repository, a Slack channel, a Google Drive folder, and a Wechat group. 
#### <i class="icon-file"></i> GitHub
: The Github repository will be used to document the main content of the project, such as the interface design files and the team’s deliverables for the course. Github URL: https://github.com/deco3500-2017/TeamBeyondBeingThere
#### <i class="icon-file"></i> Google Drive
: The Google Drive folder is for documentation of the design process and file exchange. For example, the photos of brainstorming have been uploaded to the folder. Google Drive URL: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B3s2700t81vTZ0xiWjV1R1kzTGc?usp=sharing
#### <i class="icon-file"></i> WeChat
: WeChat is the most common instant messaging app which all team members regularly use. So we set up a group in the app and use the app as the main online communication tool.
#### <i class="icon-file"></i> Slack
: A slack channel has also been set up as a supplementary approach to collaboration. Slack channel: #deco3500-clubhub


----------


### File management
In the Google Drive folder and the Github repository, files should be clearly classified and stored in folders. All names of files and folders should be understandable, and no file should remain “untitled”. Spaces are allowed to be used in file names, if necessary. 

Other rules involve: (1) Upper- and lower-cases should be properly used in file names; (2) Index number should be involved in brackets. 

For example, photos of the brainstorming process should be named as “Brainstorming (1).jpg” to “Brainstorming (3).jpg”.

Nan is in charge of checking all file names on all platforms to keep them consistent.

## Changes made based on the feedback from Pitch

#### Focus on the member’s relationship with clubs
Based on the feedback from the teaching staff, we can see the main focus of our concept was not clearly conveyed. In our pitch, we wanted to use the concept to improve the member’s relationships with both the club and other members. This was because one of the reasons why students wanted to join a club was to meet friends. Therefore, although the main focus of our concept was to enhance the social connection between the member and the club, we added some features to empower members to connect one another. However, it made the main focus ambiguous. The audience of our pitch were more curious about the supplementary features than the main features. So after receiving the feedback, we removed the feature which supported communication among members to emphasize the main feature. 

#### Differences from Facebook
Some features of our concept were similar to, but different from, Facebook Page and events. We added a section in the proposal to compare our concept to Facebook. Please refer to [Competitor analysis](#competitor-analysis).
